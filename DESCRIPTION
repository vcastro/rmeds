Description: Map medications from electronic health record (EHR) and claims
    datasets to the RXNORM vocabulary and also to various drug classes. The
    package contains mapping datasets from the RXNORM prescribable subset
    <doi:> and groupings to FDA Established Pharmaceutical Classes (EPC), VA
    drug classes (VA) and Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classifications
    extracted from RxMix <doi:>. Additional functions construct ontology
    representations in i2b2 format <doi:>.
